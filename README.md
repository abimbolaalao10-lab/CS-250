## Sprint Review and Retrospective Artifact

This repository contains my **CS 250 Sprint Review and Retrospective**, which serves as a reflection of the Agile and Scrum practices I applied during the SNHU Travel project.  
Throughout the course, I learned how Agile promotes adaptability, collaboration, and customer-focused development. This artifact demonstrates my ability to plan, communicate, and iterate effectively in a team-based software environment.

## Reflection Questions

### 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?

I interpret user needs by breaking them down into **user stories** that define specific, testable outcomes.  
Each story begins with the user’s perspective — for example:  
> “As a traveler, I want to browse top destinations with descriptions and images so I can plan my trip easily.”  

This process helps me focus on the **why** behind every feature and ensures that the code I write delivers **real user value**. User stories prevent scope confusion and maintain alignment between user expectations and software functionality.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to software development is **iterative and feedback-driven**. I prefer dividing projects into smaller, manageable sprints so that progress is visible and adaptable to change.  
The Agile processes I plan to continue using include:  
- **Sprint planning** – for structured goal setting  
- **Daily stand-ups** – to maintain communication and accountability  
- **Sprint reviews and retrospectives** – to continuously improve team performance  
- **Backlog refinement** – to keep priorities clear and actionable  

These processes keep development flexible, organized, and focused on delivering incremental value.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means **balancing technical skill with collaboration and empathy**.  
I’ve learned that effective software development depends on **clear communication, adaptability, and shared ownership** of goals.  
A strong team member contributes ideas, respects others’ viewpoints, and takes responsibility for delivering quality work.  
Through Scrum ceremonies like retrospectives and sprint reviews, I saw how open discussion and teamwork lead to better outcomes and stronger team morale.
